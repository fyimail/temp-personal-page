          Ahoy, brave navigator of the web! You've successfully docked at my
          personal slice of the internet. I'm FuMing. Think of this page as my
          brain, but tidier and with fewer tabs open. (Okay, maybe not fewer
          tabs).
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not contemplating the mysteries of the universe (like why USB
          sticks only fit on the third try), I'm the CEO and co-founder of
          <a href="https://inkubasia.com" target="_blank">Inkubasia</a>. We're
          in the business of turning 'what if' into 'what is', fueled by sheer
          will and an alarming amount of caffeine.
